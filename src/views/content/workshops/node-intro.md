While JavaScript is not strictly a functional programming language, understanding how functional programming can be applied to Node.js projects can yield more readable and testable code. In this workshop, we’ll introduce you to the basics of functional JavaScript then we’ll get right into hands-on practice to build and test our own Node.js apps. We’ll also compare and contrast object-oriented approaches with functional programming in Node.
