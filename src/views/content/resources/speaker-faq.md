## During the Conference

### Talk Schedule

The [schedule](/schedule) has been posted. As we get closer to the conference, we will send you a calendar invite so that you won't forget your talk is happening.
### Live Q&A

Following the recorded talk is a live Q&A with our Emcee. This will be limited to 3-5 minutes. You will recieve instructions on how to "dial-in" to the speaker Green Room and someone will be there to guide you into the Q&A.

### Interacting with Attendees

We are creating a special Discord server for CascadiaJS 2021. We will be using this during the conference, not our community Slack.

For every talk we are creating a dedicated Discord channel that we will encourage attendees to use to ask questions and chat about the material. We highly encourage speakers to pop-in to these channels to answer questions and generally participate in the discussions that crop-up based on their talks.
