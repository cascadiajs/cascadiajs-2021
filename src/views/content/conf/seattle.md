## Hybrid Event Venue
The CascadiaJS 2021 Hybrid Event in Seattle is taking place at MoPOP, located right in the Seattle Center:

```
MoPOP

MoPOP has a really great [planning your visit guide](https://www.mopop.org//visit/plan-your-visit/) that include more information about how to get there, accessibility information, etc. Please review it if you have any questions or concerns.

### Getting into the Venue (COVID check)

CascadiaJS attendees are asked to enter at the North/Group Entry, which is located on the Harrison Street turnaround on the North/silver side of the building. There is a black walkway canopy covering the entry way and a large illuminated sign to the left of the entry.

MoPOP staff will be checking for two things upon entry:

1. Your name must be on a list of registered attendees for the Seattle Hybrid Event
2. You must present proof of vaccination

More information on acceptable forms of proof can be found at:

### Inside MoPOP

Once you are inside, you will be directed to the Learning Labs, where we will have:
