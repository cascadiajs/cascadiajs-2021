We here at CascadiaJS acknowledge our events today are taking place on the unceded land and territories of numerous first people and first nations. We thank them for having cared for these lands and waters since time out of mind, and look forward to working with them in partnership as the Pacific Northwest continues to grow.

## Seattle, WA

We acknowledge that we are on the traditional land of the first people of Seattle, the Duwamish People past and present and honor with gratitude the land itself and the Duwamish Tribe.
