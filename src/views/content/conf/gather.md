Gather is the platform we are using for face-to-face video chat in our Hallway Track. The link to join this virtual space is located on the [Dashboard](/home/dashboard).

Here's what you can expect:

- A fully digital space that you can walk around in, with the freedom to come and go as you please.
- The ability to chat in groups based on proximity.
- Tables for those personal 1:1 conversations, that are "private spaces"
- Common interest areas, including things like "React.js", "Portland, OR" and "Junior Devs"!
- An Expo Hall where you can meet and greet our wonderful sponsors!
- A theatre where you can enjoy watching the Live Stream!

Straight from the help desk of Gather, "Gather works best for users who have hi-speed internet access. While we have a desktop version of Gather in beta, we recommend using Gather in a web browser at this time. Chrome and Firefox work best."

In order to enter the Gather Space, you *must* use the same email address you used the register for the conference. Select “Send magic link”. (Do NOT Sign in with Google). You will receive an email with a link. Click on it and it will take you to a new browser page where you can successfully sign in. Close that browser window and go back to the original browser window that had the Welcome to Gather box in it and join the Gathering. Unfortunately, every time you enter into the system you will have to take these steps.

## Tips on using Gather 
### Search for a specific attendee
You can search for a specific person by name in the “Participants” panel on the left, and click their name to find or chat with them

### Quiet Mode 
If you need to get some head's down work done, but don't want to leave the space you can use Quiet Mode (Ctrl/Cmd + U). With Quiet Mode on, your status light next to your name turns red, and you engage with other's A/V feeds when they are in a tile directly adjacent to you.

### Ghost Mode
If someone wants to walk through a Space without disrupting other people's conversations, they can use Ghost Mode (press or hold "g"). In Ghost Mode, you can simply walk through people (this is also handy if an entrance is clogged when heading to or from a meeting).
