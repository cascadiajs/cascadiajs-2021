title: Conference Onboarding Instructions
---

Unlike a purely on-site event, participating in CascadiaJS 2021 is a little more complicated than just showing up at a venue and walking through the door. We've npm installed half a dozen apps and platforms to make this conference possible, so please follow these steps to make sure you're configured and ready to go!

## Hybrid Events (Seattle, Portland, Vancouver BC)

Information on how to get to these events, what COVID vaccine proof to bring, where after parties are, etc can be found on each event's page:

- [Seattle Hybrid Event at MoPOP](/conf/seattle)
- [Portland Hybrid Event at OMSI](/conf/portland)
- [Vancouver Hybrid Event at UBC Robson](/conf/vancouver)

## Goodie Boxes

First, we know that many of you have not gotten email notifications yet about your Goodie Boxes shipping. We are deeply disappointed in this, because we couldn't wait to see you all wearing your CascadiaJS hoodies and decorating your laptops with the stickers we sent you.

COVID has really messed-up supply chains all over the world, so all we can ask for is your patience. We PROMISE that your Goodie Box will arrive and we're sorry it didn't get there sooner.

## Talk Track

You can access to conference livestream by logging-in to your [Conference Dashboard](/home). In order to log-in you will need an Access Code.

Conveniently, you can find this Access Code at the bottom of all of the emails that we've sent you! Here's a screenshot of where to find it:

In order to ensure that everything is working properly, please copy that Access Code and use it to log-in to your [Conference Dashboard](/home).

## Workshop Track

In your Dashboard, you will find links to all 4 of the workshops being run on Nov 3 and 4. These workshops are FREE, but seats are limited so please make sure you pre-register and save your seat.

Also, please note that if you're struggling to choose between attending a workshop or watching a talk, all of the talks are being recorded and will be available after the conference. 

## Hallway Track 

We have two options for folks to hang out and chat in the all-important Hallway Track: Gather and Discord. You'll find links to both in the Dashboard soon. We plan to open the virtual doors to these spaces at 8am PDT on Nov 3.

Gather is a virtual space that we have fully customized for your enjoyment. You'll find places to chat about different technologies, an Expo Hall with a bunch of our awesome sponsors, and other surprises. You can even watch the livestream from within Gather, and hear people as they clap or cheer! There's a table to the right of the stage where some speakers will be available for Q&A after their talks.

NOTE: Gather uses a guest list to restrict access. You *must* log-in to Gather using the same email address you used to register for the conference.

Discord is text chat, kind of like Slack but much better for communities and events like ours. We've got channels for everything, so definitely check it out!

## Digital Swag

We built some [digital swag](/conf/digital-swag) for you in the form of Snap Camera lenses! Anytime you're in an experience with your camera on you can switch your camera to Snap Camera and use one of these cool lenses. ðŸ˜Ž

Feel free to take a selfie using one of these lenses and send us a tweet using the official #CascadiaJS hashtag.

## Photo Booth

Hop into the [CascadiaJS Photo Booth](https://cascadiajs-photo-app.herokuapp.com/home)! Record yourself saying "hello", download the animated gif, and share it in the Discord and on Twitter!

The Photo Booth is brought to you by our friends at [Salesforce Developers](https://developer.salesforce.com/) and their amazing [Fostive](https://github.com/fostive) open source project.

## Getting Help
